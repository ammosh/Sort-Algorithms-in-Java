Sort-Algorithms-in-Java
=======================

Sort algorithms are used for ordering items in an array with regard to a predefined order. Here is the implementation of some popular sorting algorithms in Java. Implementing the quick sort and merge sort are a bit tricky. They can be implemented using loops and also recursion. I chose to implement them using recursion since I like recursion the most. I have implemented the following sort algorithms:

- [Bubble Sort]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
- [Insertion Sort]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
- [Merge Sort]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
- [Quick Sort]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)

#How to use it

In order to use the sort classes, just add them into your project and create an instance of each sort module and call the related `sort` method.
